/**
 * Format-agnostic in-document text search (IX2 — findText).
 *
 * All three formats (docx / pptx / xlsx) already emit their rendered text as an
 * ordered list of runs through `onTextRun` (the same stream IX1 turned into the
 * hyperlink-aware selection overlay). A run is the atomic drawn text segment: a
 * docx line-piece, a pptx shape run, an xlsx cell. Search is therefore the same
 * problem in every format — concatenate the run texts, match a query against the
 * joined string, and map each match back to the run(s) it fell on so the viewer
 * can draw a highlight box over the right glyphs. That reverse mapping is the
 * only subtle part (a query can straddle two runs — "Hello" split as "Hel"+"lo"),
 * and it is pure string/index math with no DOM or geometry, so it lives here in
 * `core` and is shared, not re-implemented per package.
 *
 * What stays out of core: turning a matched run-slice into a pixel rectangle
 * needs the run's font + `measureText`, which is renderer/DOM territory and
 * differs per format (docx flat spans, pptx shape-relative + rotation, xlsx cell
 * rects). Each package owns that final step; core owns the index + the match →
 * run-slice resolution.
 *
 * Normalization (IX2 default, integrator may veto): case-insensitive by default
 * (`caseSensitive: false`), matching a browser's Ctrl+F. Full-/half-width (zenkaku
 * ↔ hankaku) folding and diacritic-insensitive matching are intentionally NOT
 * done in this minimal pass — they are locale-sensitive and easy to get subtly
 * wrong; a later opt-in can add them without changing this contract. Case
 * folding is length-preserving (see {@link foldPreservingLength}): the few code
 * points whose lowercase changes UTF-16 length (e.g. U+0130 İ) match by
 * identity only, so match offsets always index the original text.
 */

/**
 * The minimal shape the index needs from a rendered run: just its text. Each
 * package passes its own richer run info (which also carries geometry) — this is
 * structurally satisfied by `DocxTextRunInfo`, `PptxTextRunInfo`,
 * `XlsxTextRunInfo`, etc., so a caller hands its `runs[]` straight in.

 * `text` can be resolved back to a (run, offset-within-run) pair by binary
 * search. `folded` is the case-folded form used for matching when the search is
 * case-insensitive. INVARIANT: `folded.length === text.length` — guaranteed by
 * {@link foldPreservingLength} — so a match offset found in `folded` indexes
 * `text` directly. (A whole-string `toLowerCase()` does NOT hold this: e.g.
 * U+0130 İ lowercases to "i" + U+0307 combining dot, 1 → 2 UTF-16 code units,
 * which would shift every later match right by the delta and could even push a
