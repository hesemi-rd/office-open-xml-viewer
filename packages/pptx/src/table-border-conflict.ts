/**
 * DrawingML table (`<a:tbl>`) — adjacent-cell border conflict resolution.
 *
 * SPEC IS SILENT. ECMA-376 / ISO-29500 define the WordprocessingML analog
 * (§17.4.66 `tcBorders` conflict rules) but give NO conflict-resolution rule for
 * a DrawingML/PresentationML table: `<a:tcPr>` carries `<a:lnL>` / `<a:lnR>` /
 * `<a:lnT>` / `<a:lnB>` per cell, and when cell spacing is zero two neighbouring
 * cells each contribute a line for the shared interior gridline — but the spec
 * never says which one PowerPoint displays. The renderer previously drew BOTH,
 * so the later-painted cell won by paint order (and with a translucent line the
 * overlap doubled the ink density). This module is the pure kernel that picks a
 * single winner so each shared gridline is drawn exactly once.
 *
 * Because the spec is silent, the rules below are OUR OWN DETERMINISTIC choice
 * (they are NOT quoted from ECMA-376). They mirror the SHAPE of the docx
 * §17.4.66 resolver (see `docx/src/cell-border-conflict.ts`) but adapted to the
 * DrawingML data model, where a suppressed line (`<a:ln><a:noFill/></a:ln>`) is
 * parsed to `null` — there is no `nil`/`none` style marker to carry, so a
 * missing/suppressed edge is simply the `null` candidate.
 *
 * Rules, applied in order:
 *   0. A `null` candidate (absent OR `<a:noFill>` line) contributes nothing — the
 *      OTHER side is displayed. Both `null` ⇒ nothing (`null`).
 *   1. Both real ⇒ the WIDER line wins (larger `<a:ln w>` in EMU). PowerPoint has
 *      no style "weight" table like Word's; line width is the natural strength
 *      ordering for DrawingML strokes.
 *   2. Equal width ⇒ the DARKER colour wins (smaller perceived luminance), so the
 *      choice is deterministic and independent of paint order.
 *   3. Fully tied (equal width AND equal luminance) ⇒ the OWNING side (`a`, the
 *      cell first in reading order) is displayed. The caller passes the
 *      reading-order-first cell as `a` (interior vertical → the LEFT cell;
 *      interior horizontal → the ABOVE cell), matching the ownership convention
 *      that draws each line exactly once.

/** Parse a 6- or 8-hex colour to (r,g,b). `null`/malformed ⇒ black (0,0,0). The
 *  DrawingML stroke colour is stored without a leading `#`; an 8-hex value's
 *  trailing alpha pair is ignored for the luminance comparison. */
