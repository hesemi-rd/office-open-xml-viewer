// Justified text alignment for the pptx renderer.
//
// DrawingML offers four "fill the column" alignments (ECMA-376 §20.1.10.59
// ST_TextAlignType): `just` and `justLow` justify a line by widening its
// inter-word and inter-CJK gaps to reach the column width, leaving the
// paragraph's LAST line natural (the spec notes it "does not justify
// sentences which are short"); `dist` and `thaiDist` distribute the same way
// but justify EVERY line, the last included ("Distributes the text words
// across an entire text line"). justLow/thaiDist are the low-quality variants
// — same distribution, only the kashida/glyph-stretch sophistication differs,
// which Canvas cannot reproduce — so we treat just≡justLow and dist≡thaiDist.
//
// `just` and `dist` use the SAME gap selection (inter-word AND inter-CJK) and
// differ ONLY in the last line (just: natural, dist: filled). This is
// intentionally NOT WordprocessingML's ST_Jc model (§17.18.44), where `both`
// stretches inter-word space only and `distribute` adds inter-character pitch:
// DrawingML/PowerPoint justifies CJK under `just` too — a pure-CJK `just` line
// fills to the column edge in PowerPoint (its same-name PDF is the ground truth
// here; §17.18.44 governs Word, not PowerPoint). The spec's "smart … does not
// justify sentences which are short" clause is realized as the last-line rule
// only; no length threshold is invented for other short lines (the spec gives
// no metric, and a guess would be a heuristic).
//
// The gap geometry itself lives in the shared kernel
// `@silurus/ooxml-core` → `distributeLineSlack` (packages/core/src/text/
// line-distribute.ts), shared with the docx justifier. This module is a thin
// pptx adapter: it owns the DrawingML last-line policy and the slack threshold,
// injects PowerPoint's whitespace predicate (every JS `\s` char is an inter-word
// space — wider than Word's U+0020/U+3000 set), and re-expresses the kernel's
// per-segment result as stretch annotations the renderer applies in place.
//
// Why character-level, not segment-level: the layout merges adjacent
// same-style tokens into ONE segment (see layoutParagraph's `push`/`sameMeta`),
// so a plain paragraph line is usually a single segment holding the whole
// string. Justification therefore has to look INSIDE each segment's text: a
// stretch opportunity is an inter-word space OR an inter-CJK boundary anywhere
// in the line's character stream (boundaries are evaluated across segment
// edges too, so a colour change mid-word doesn't suppress a gap).
//
// `justifyLine` annotates each input segment with `jext` (px to advance AFTER
// the segment when its trailing boundary is a gap) and, when the segment has
// internal gaps, `splitBefore` (code-point offsets) + `perGap` (px). The
// renderer draws each segment in place: if `splitBefore` is empty it does one
// `fillText(seg.text)` and advances by `measureText(seg.text) + jext`; if not,
// it uses `justifiedPiecePositions` (from `@silurus/ooxml-core`) to anchor each
// piece to the whole-string prefix advance — required to avoid 約物半角
// measurement drift, where `Σ measureText(piece)` would exceed
// `measureText(seg.text)` because isolated punctuation loses its contextual
// half-width collapse. The sum of all `jext` plus all `perGap × splits` equals
// the slack, so the painted line reaches `availWidth`.
