/**
 * Pure geometry for the cell-comment hover popup. Kept free of DOM so it can be
 * unit-tested in isolation; the viewer owns the actual element and feeds it
 * measured rects.
 *
 * Excel shows a comment/note as a small box anchored at the commented cell's
 * top-right corner, opening toward the sheet body. This calculator reproduces
 * that placement and adds viewport-aware flipping/clamping so the popup is
 * always fully visible.
 *
 * All coordinates are in canvasArea CSS-pixel space — the same space
 * `getCellRect` and the selection overlay use. The cell rect is therefore
 * already RTL-mirrored by the caller (via `screenX`); the `rtl` flag here only
 * picks the *default* open direction (left for RTL so the popup grows into the
 * mirrored sheet body rather than off the right edge).
