/**
 * XL5 furigana (phonetic-hint) geometry.
 *
 * Pure layout math for the ruby-like phonetic band Excel draws across the top
 * of a cell (ECMA-376 §18.4.6 `<rPh>` / §18.4.3 `<phoneticPr>`). Kept free of
 * any Canvas dependency (a `measure` callback is injected) so the placement is
 * unit-testable without a DOM.
 *
 * Not shared with the docx ruby renderer: docx ruby is laid out per line inside
 * the paragraph engine (grid pitch, ascent reserve, per-glyph baseline), while
 * xlsx furigana is placed relative to the CELL rectangle and the base string's
 * horizontal glyph advances. The only common idea ("small text above base") is
 * two lines of Canvas code, so a shared core primitive would be a
 * false-abstraction. The pure predicate here (offset → x-span) is xlsx-specific.
